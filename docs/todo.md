# Todo List

Current phase: **Phase 5 — HITL + 3-Agent Parallel (next)**

Last updated: 2026-05-13

---

## Completed — Phase 0 (Project Setup)

- [x] Create project folder structure
- [x] Initialize Poetry project (`pyproject.toml`)
- [x] Create `.env.example` with all config keys
- [x] Create `config/settings.py` using Pydantic Settings
- [x] Create module stub files (all methods raise `NotImplementedError`)
- [x] Create `run_agent.py` entry point (loads task YAML, supports `--skip-preflight`)
- [x] Set up structlog + Rich logging (`config/logging_config.py`)
- [x] Set up pytest with smoke test
- [x] Initialize git repository (initial commit `73013b8`)
- [x] Add `.gitignore` for Python, `.env`, screenshots, downloads
- [ ] Verify all dependencies install cleanly on Windows dev machine — pending (current dev box is macOS)

---

## Completed — Phase 1 (Core Loop + Vision)

- [x] `memory/working.py` — typed in-process working memory
- [x] `agent/loop.py` — observe → reason → act → store cycle with stub executor
- [x] `agent/perception.py` — mss capture + Pillow preprocess + local VLM call
- [x] Local VLM integration — ScreenState JSON (Ollama/vLLM via OpenAI client; no external APIs per CLAUDE.md)
- [x] `agent/planner.py` — ActionPlan via local LLM
- [x] `agent/schemas.py` — ScreenState / ActionPlan / ActionResult Pydantic models
- [x] Confidence threshold check → HITL routing (`SessionMemory.write_hitl`)
- [x] Max loop step guard (`settings.max_loop_steps`)
- [x] Retry-limit guard → forced `flag_human`
- [x] Audit log writer (`agent/audit.py`, append-only NDJSON)
- [x] Unit tests for schemas / perception / planner / loop (mocked VLM)
- [ ] Real-screen end-to-end validation on Windows box w/ Ollama — pending hardware

Notes / assumptions:
- Roadmap originally said "Claude Vision API"; CLAUDE.md non-negotiable forbids external LLMs.
  Phase 1 is implemented against the local OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama dev, vLLM prod).
- `executors/*` and `memory/knowledge.py` remain stubs; `StubExecutor` returns `deferred`.
- `mss` only imports inside `PerceptionLayer.capture()` — keeps unit tests runnable headless.

---

## Completed — Phase 2 (Browser)

- [x] `executors/browser.py` full Playwright implementation (`BrowserSession` + `BrowserExecutor`)
- [x] Selector resolution strategy (`executors/selectors.py`) — testid → aria → name → text → fallback
- [x] `ActionRouter` browser routing (`agent/router.py`)
- [x] `memory/session.py` extended (start/complete/log_action/log_extraction/get_actions)
- [x] Checkpoint + action-log write after every step
- [x] Task YAMLs: `login.yaml`, `claim_search.yaml`, `form_fill.yaml`
- [x] Deterministic step-list task mode (runs YAML without the LLM — used for CI)
- [x] Starter `config/locators/rdweb.py` (LOGIN + CLAIM_SEARCH + FORM + ALL aggregate)
- [x] Vendored sim HTML pages under `tests/sim/pages/` (login / claim_search / form)
- [x] Integration tests against the vendored sim — real Chromium, both LD-shaped and IIM-shaped flows
- [x] Full-loop deterministic e2e run via `run_agent.py` (`config/tasks/claim_search.yaml` returns `status=success`)

Notes / blockers carried forward:
- The full 120+ POC locator map lands when `insurance-agent-project` is available; current `rdweb.py` is a starter for the vendored sim only.
- "LD simulation" / "IIM simulation" external servers from the roadmap don't exist in this repo; vendored sim pages cover the same shape and unblock Phase 2 acceptance.
- Real-application URLs (production LD/IIM) still need confirmation — flagged in "Decisions Needed".

## Completed — Phase 3 (Desktop + RDP)

- [x] `executors/rdp.py` — mstsc launch via `subprocess.Popen`, RemoteApp window detection via `DesktopExecutor.attach()`
- [x] RDP keep-alive thread (daemon, mouse-nudge every `keepalive_seconds`)
- [x] Disconnect detection (`detect_disconnect`) + reconnect with attempt counter and `MAX_RECONNECTS=3`
- [x] `executors/desktop.py` — `DesktopExecutor` with `attach / click / type_text / select_option / read_text / wait_for`, pywinauto-UIA backend, lazy import (loads cleanly on macOS)
- [x] `executors/file_ops.py` — `FileExecutor` with `copy_to_local / find_latest_file / acquire_lock / release_lock / open_in_explorer / open_file / with_temp_copy`
- [x] ActionRouter desktop / rdp / file routing (`ROUTING_TABLE` + `plan.app` override)
- [x] `ActionPlan` extended with `select_option / file_navigate / file_open / rdp_launch / rdp_reconnect / rdp_disconnect` action types and an `app` scope field
- [x] `agent/perception.py` — `capture(target=bbox)` already accepts an mss bbox dict; RDP window bbox surfaced via `RDPHandler.window_bbox()`
- [x] `agent/recovery.py` — `RecoveryHandler` returns `RecoveryDirective(retry / skip / rdp_reconnect / hitl / abort)` for blocking modals, error screens, RDP disconnects, transient errors, reconnect-limit, and unknown failures
- [x] Hard retry cap added to `AgentLoop._store` — deterministic-mode steps now route to HITL after `RETRY_LIMIT=3` repeated failures (closes the infinite-retry hole found during validation)
- [x] Task YAML for browser→RDP handoff (`config/tasks/rdp_launch.yaml`)
- [x] Mock-based unit tests for desktop/rdp/file_ops (44 new tests; pywinauto + subprocess fully mocked — Windows runtime validation tracked in `docs/assumptions.md` A-06 / A-08 / A-09 / A-10 / A-11)

End-to-end validation on macOS dev box:
- `pytest tests/` → **94 passed** (50 from Phases 0-2 + 44 new).
- Phase 2 regression: `LD_BASE_URL=file://.../sim/pages python run_agent.py --task config/tasks/claim_search.yaml --skip-preflight` → `agent_complete status=success exit_reason=task_complete steps=6`.
- Phase 3 browser→RDP handoff: 4 browser steps succeed, `rdp_launch` raises the documented "mstsc is Windows-only" error (A-06), retry cap fires after 3 attempts, HITL routed cleanly, agent exits.

---

## Completed — Phase 4 (PDF + Memory)

- [x] `executors/extraction.py` — `ExtractionPipeline` with three tiers (pdfplumber 0.92 conf → Tesseract OCR 0.78 → local VLM ≤0.81). `FieldSpec` carries aliases + regex + financial flag. Per-field gating: failed fields land in `result.fields` with `confidence=0.0, hitl_required=True`.
- [x] `memory/knowledge.py` — `KnowledgeStore` Protocol + `ChromaKnowledgeStore` (real, persistent, buffered writes flushed at end-of-task per CLAUDE.md) + `NullKnowledgeStore` (no-op fallback when `chromadb` isn't installed). `get_knowledge_store()` picks at runtime.
- [x] `executors/file_ops.py` Excel ops — `read_excel` (list-of-dicts, blank-row skip, retry on `OSError`), `write_excel` (atomic via `.tmp` + replace, overwrite guard), `update_excel_cell` (column letter or 1-based index).
- [x] `extract_pdf` + `read_excel` action types routed to `FileExecutor` via `ActionRouter`.
- [x] `config/tasks/extract_pdf.yaml` task YAML.
- [x] Tests: 9 extraction, 10 knowledge, 7 Excel — all passing without a live VLM/chromadb (real openpyxl + Pillow used; chromadb behind a faithful fake client).

## Known Gaps — Phase 3/4 (Carry-Forward)

The following were identified during Phase 3/4 validation and are intentionally deferred:

- [ ] **`RecoveryHandler` not wired into `AgentLoop`** — `agent/recovery.py` is fully implemented and tested in isolation, but `AgentLoop._run_loop()` never calls `recovery.detect(screen, working)` (before reasoning) or `recovery.recover(plan, result, working)` (after a failed action). Blocking modal auto-dismiss, RDP auto-reconnect, and transient-error retry routing are therefore inactive at runtime. Basic HITL escalation still functions via the planner's `_enforce_hitl_rules`. Wire in Phase 5 when the loop gains checkpoint-resume and multi-agent isolation. Tracked in: `agent/recovery.py` + `agent/loop.py._run_loop()`.
- [ ] **`DesktopExecutor._window` auto-attach may hang on macOS/Linux CI** — `_window()` calls `self.attach()` when the window isn't in `_apps`, which blocks for `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_S`. This is correct on Windows but can slow down the non-Windows test suite if `title_re` is non-None and no app is pre-seeded. Mitigated by always pre-seeding `_apps` in tests.
- [ ] **`ExtractionPipeline` VLM tier only sends page 1** — Multi-page PDFs send only the first page to the VLM. The `FieldSpec.aliases` page-hint mechanism is stubbed (comment only). Extend `_tier_vlm` to loop over pages when a spec requests a non-first page.
- [ ] **Windows runtime validation pending** — RDP/desktop/mstsc paths require a Windows host with `pywinauto`, `mss`, and the App VM accessible. Tracked in `docs/assumptions.md` A-06 / A-08 / A-09 / A-10.

## Queued — Phase 5 (HITL + 3 Agents)

- [ ] `hitl/queue.py`
- [ ] `hitl/server.py` dashboard
- [ ] Agent checkpoint resume after HITL
- [ ] 3-agent parallel test
- [ ] HITL dashboard multi-agent view
- [ ] Wire `RecoveryHandler` into `AgentLoop._run_loop()` (see carry-forward above)

---

## Queued — Phase 6 (Hardening)

- [ ] Full end-to-end test
- [ ] Error injection tests
- [ ] Performance tuning
- [ ] `docs/runbook.md`
- [ ] `docs/demo-script.md`
- [ ] Demo recording

---

## Decisions Needed

- [ ] Confirm whether real LD application is browser-based or desktop app
- [ ] Confirm whether real IIM application type (web / WinForms / Java / mainframe)
- [ ] Confirm App VM IP and RD Web URL for integration testing
- [ ] Confirm whether Claude API can be used during demo, or needs on-prem LLM
- [ ] Confirm ANTHROPIC_API_KEY availability for dev environment

---

## Known Risks to Monitor

- pywinauto UIA backend requires Windows — verify dev machine is Windows before Phase 3
- mss screenshot speed degrades if display scaling is not 100% — configure before Phase 1
- ChromaDB may need `chroma_db_impl=duckdb+parquet` config on Windows — test in Phase 4
- FastAPI HITL server port 8080 may conflict with other services — confirm early
